### The Pocketknife Pledge:

In return for the privilege of carrying a pocketknife to designated Cub Scout functions, I agree to the following:

* I will treat my pocketknife with the respect due a useful tool.
* I will always close my pocketknife and put it away when not in use.
* I will not use my pocketknife when it might injure someone near me.
* I promise never to throw my pocketknife for any reason.
* I will use my pocketknife in a safe manner at all times.

### Knives Are Not Toys Guidelines

* Close the blade with the palm of your hand.
* Never use a knife on something that will dull or break it.
* Be Careful that you do not cut yourself or any person nearby.
* Never use a knife to strip the bark from a tree.
* Do not carve your initials into anything that does not belong to you.

### Knife Safety Rules

* A knife is a tool, not a toy
* Know how to sharpen a knife. 
* A sharp knife is safer than a dull knife because it is less likely to slip and cut you.
* Keep the blade clean.
* Never carry an open pocketknife
* When you are not using your knife, close it and put it away.
* When you are using the cutting blade, do not try to make big shavings or chips. Eay does it.
* Make a safety circle. Before you pick up your knife to use it, stretch your arm out and turn in a circle.
* If you cannot touch anyone or anything else, it is safe to use your knife. 
* While using your knife, be sure to watch in case someone walks toward you and gets too close.
