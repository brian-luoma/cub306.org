## Current Status - Updated September 2021
Pack 306 is meeting outdoors at Catonsville Presbyterian Church between the church and Hillcrest Elementary school. Each den is able to change its location for hikes or for special activities so keep in communication with your den leaders. It has been our policies to follow the lead of the Baltimore County Public Schools in Catonsville, if they close we close (during snow) and now if they meet remotely, then we meet remotely. During signup we are asking parents to indicate their level of COVID sensitivity. Pack size meetings on CPC grounds are subject to the church's policies.

## Video Meetings - By Den
As of right now, video meetings are not required, however as scouts we intend to Be Prepared. Some video meetings are actually preferred where reach out remotely! Here are the  basic rules to be followed in a video meeting:

* A Parent shall supervise their child(ren) on meetings
* Only one person should be un-muted at a time unless told otherwise
* We are standardizing on Google Meet

Some Den leaders may offer to work with individual scouts to complete requirements. We will require that the parents help set up connections on their side and be present during the chat.

"Be Prepared"
