## Current Status
Pack 306 has not restarted any in person event. Currently we are waiting for clearance to re-enter the CPC facilities before we can even begin to restart in person events. As we all know, we are currently in Stage 3 of reopening, and we are waiting to see what the local schools plan to do with their schedules. It has been our policies to follow the lead of the Baltimore County Public Schools in Catonsville, if they close we close (durring snow) and now if they meet remotely, then we meet remotely. Durring signup we are asking parents to indicate how they feel about in person events, and if a full den agrees (all parents and leaders) to meet then we will begin den size in-person events. Pack size meetings on CPC grounds are subject to the church's policies.

## Video Meetings
We will be having web meetings for the time being. While not ideal we can provided for a more informal gathering then school video meetings, however we ask that some basic rules be followed:

* Parent Supervision
* Only one person should be un-mute at a time unless told otherwise
* We are standardizing on Google Meet

Some Den leaders may offer to work with individual scouts to complete requirements. We will require that the parents help set up connections on their side and be present during the chat.

## All Future Events
By our current plans we are to have one in person event this November and then begin all in person events by the new calendar year. Our plans enable us to change to either be more open, or less open based on community need. For instance, if schools reopen to in-person classes then there may be little reason for us to not do the same (since the virus will already be able to spread through school). If the schools remain on lock down we will do the same so we do not create a back door vector for spreading. If we go back to stage 2, we have continuity plans for continuing what events we have planed in person on line (converting pinewood derby to a live streaming event). 

We understand that this is not ideal. All of us wanted our kids in scouts to expand their horizons, push their buttons, and make better people out of them. All we can do now is show them how we live up to the Scout Motto:

"Be Prepared"
