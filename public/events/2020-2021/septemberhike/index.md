On September 26th and 27th join us on a socially distant hike through Catonsville. On either or both of these two days walk our path and interact with the pack by taking selfies to post on our Pack Facebook page and leaving chalk messages for other scouts to read. There is no official start or end to the path, so everyone can enter and leave the path when they see fit. There is also no set time, so hopefully we will all randomly be apart and safe while still participating in a shared event.

The entire circuit is 1.37 miles while just the path from the church to Peace A Pizza is 0.67 a miles. The section through the neighborhood is about 0.7 miles.
