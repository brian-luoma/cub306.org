# Fall Campout #


Our camping coordinator [Wil Heslop](camping@cub306.org) is putting the final touches to the schedule and menu for the family campout. Last years "pot-luck" style worked out pretty well so we will try it again. Expect a "google sheets" link soon for sining up. This year we are changing the days, camping from Saturday to Sunday to allow for more day time adventures such as more hikes, more running, and by all means noise!
