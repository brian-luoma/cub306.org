![QR Code to Rules](/cgi-bin/qrc.cgi?size=128&path=events/2020-2021/pinewood-derby/rules.md)
Cars must follow the rules or they will not be accepted. Cars may also not come into contact with other cars and may be removed from racing if we can not make accommodations. Please avoid adding to many decorations on the sides of the cars.

* [Official Race Car Rules](rules.md)
    * Remember 5 ounces, no more! Light cars WILL NOT WIN!
    * Note Bottom clearance!
    * Cars found to interfere with other cars can not be raced!

<br style="clear:both">

Cars should be built by the scout according to their age. As scouts age up, they should be taking more control over their car. Webelos should be doing everything, on the other end Lions will need help with everything. Bear and up should be able to use tools. Tiger and Wolf will need supervision. No scout runs a power tool.

Like in years past, we will have some bandsaws set up and available for cutting blocks. Please come in with a design in hand and drawn in pencil on the block itself. Be prepared to change your design if the bandsaw operator does not feel the design is posible, or safe.

We will offer only one day for cutting this year and you **must** signup for a timeslot on the signup sheet.
