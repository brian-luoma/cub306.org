## Current Status
Pack 306 has suspended all in person event for the duration of the shut down. We do not anticipate returning to in-person events till we all hear from the [Maryland Government](https://coronavirus.maryland.gov) that it is safe to do so. Pack Leaders are meeting every two weeks to decided how to move forward. If you have any questions or suggestions (or would like to get involved) please email the [Cub Master](mailto:cubmaster@cub306.org).

## Video Meetings
Some of us are having success with Video Den meetings. We are still working things out so please be patient. If your Den organizes a meeting we ask that some basic rules be followed:

* Parent Supervision
* Only one person should be un-mute at a time

Some Den leaders may offer to work with individual scouts to complete requirements. We will require that the parents help set up connections on their side and be present during the chat.

## All Future Events

Two events to highlight now are:

* Virtual Campout being planned so scouts can finish out their requirements (camping in your back yard and posting on line while we muddle through this shut down.)
* Spring Campout is moving to June 6th and 7th at Fort Frederick

## Home Activities For Scouts
Some example activities to keep your scouts busy.

### The New Yo-Yo Adventure
This preview adventure (meaning its a new award being tested out) gives Wolf, Bear, and Webelos Scouts the opportunity to learn the concepts that make a yo-yo work and the basic physics of a pendulum. The adventure has only 7 requirements. As a parent you can record the achievements in Scout Book Link on resource page). If you don't feel comfortable using Scout Book you can send photos of your scout demonstrating the requirements to [Sparky Zivin](mailto:awards@cub306.org?subject=yo-yo) who can record it for you.

I would also like to mention that the resource page has both videos and lesson plans? It's a pre-canned event wrapped in a box just perfect for being locked in a house for weeks with nothing to do!

### Youth Protection Pamphlet
There is a pamphlet on the inside cover of all the Cub Scout handbooks. This needs to be done at home before the yearly awards can be given out. If you lost yours here is a link below. Report completion to your Den leader.

### Emergency Preparedness Award

The Bear den is working remotely on the Emergency Preparedness Award which is a really nice idea. Given the current news and abundance of time on our hands everyone from Tiger to Arrow of Light can work on this. Reach out to Eric Silva for tips on how to do these requirements at home.

* [Eric Silva](mailto:bear1@cub306.org)

NOTE, requirement 4 for Tiger, let me see what we can do to help with that. (We could a video chat or something if there is interest.)

### Anything from a Cub Scout Handbook

Scout still need a task, pull out the Cub Scout hand book and pick something they can do at home. Remember, Bears and above can use tool. Any task you do at home can be signed off by your Den leader or [Sparky Zivin](mailto:awards@cub306.org?subject=at%20home%20work). Or just start checking things off in the scout book and show us in person when we all meet again.
