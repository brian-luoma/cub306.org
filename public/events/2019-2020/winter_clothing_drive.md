Suit Up for Eric Loewner's Eagle Scout Project to Benefit Helping Up Mission

Eagle Scout candidate Eric Loewner is asking for assistance from the Troop and Pack for his Eagle Scout project.  Eric is working with Helping Up Mission, a men's rehabilitation shelter in Baltimore, to collect gently used men's suits and business attire for their members. Helping Up Mission has a yearlong religious based program in which they help men recover from addiction.  As part of their program, they provide the men access to proper clothing for job interviews and for when they re-enter the work force.    

Starting Thursday, December 19 and continuing through Thursday, January 16 there will be a collection box in the Scout Room to collect men's suits, ties, dress shirts, dress pants, suit and sport jackets.  The clothing articles should be in good condition, current styles, no stains or tears, no missing buttons, and the zippers must work.

To help with cleaning costs, Eric will be having a fundraiser at Peace of Pizza on Mellor Ave. on Wednesday, January 15, 2020 from 4 to 8 pm.  Part of the sales that night will go towards his fundraising efforts.  If you can join him for dine-in or carry-out, let them know at the register it is for Eric's Eagle Project.  He will have a collection box there as well for any additional clothing donations.
