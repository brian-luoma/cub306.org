Inside the scout rooms we will have several stations to answer questions and try to speed you along through the sign-up. We want to try to get as much paper work done up front as we can so we don't have to ask to many questions latter in the year.

1. Registration and Payment
    * New scouts need to fill out a  registration form, and only the [abbreviated form][more_info] for returning scouts
    * Dues are $70 + $12 for boys life - we will have a Square this year
2. Email Signup Station
    * This year we have a Pack announcement list and Den Announcement lists
    * Confirm Scoutbook settings for returning scouts
3. Forms and Handouts
    * [BSA Medical Form A & B][bsa_med_a_b]
    * [BSA Talent Survey][bsa_talent] - this is recommended by BSA, it helps us know if anyone has any special skills which we could leverage for program activities.
    * [T-Shirt Sizes][shirt_sizes]
    * [Calendar][calendar] - will have printed copies
    * [Pack Contacts][contacts]
4. Swap table - Bring your old stuff in
    * Uniform
    * Handbook Swap
5. Popcorn App Setup
    * Get setup with the new Popcorn app
    * Facebook Group Setup

Outside we will have a "raingutter regatta" for the scouts to participate in while adults are inside. Water will be involved so Pack T-Shirts is recommended instead of uniforms.
