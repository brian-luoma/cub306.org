## Full Race Results

For full race results you can download these files:

* [Raw data](RaceResults.csv) as a CSV
* [Data](RaceResults.pdf) as a PDF plus some charts

In the PDF is a chart like the one below. The chart shows how your scouts car did for each of its runs. Each row is one scout and is listed by car number. A night grouping means the care preformed pretty much the same regardless of run, a wider gap shows more erratic results.

## Track
Plotting all the results by track shows a slight advantage to track 1 and a disadvantage on 3. This could just be either the track or the ground not being perfect. Overall we are looking at about a 0.2 sec difference.
