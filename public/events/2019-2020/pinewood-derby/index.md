## <i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i> Rules ##

Cars must follow the rules or they will not be accepted. Cars may also not come into contact with other cars and may be removed from racing if we can not make accommodations. Please avoid adding to many decorations on the sides of the cars.

* [Official Race Car Rules](rules.md)

Cars should be built by the scout according to their age. As scouts age up, they should be taking more control over their car. Webelos should be doing everything, on the other end Lions will need help with everything. Bear and up should be able to use tools. Tiger and Wolf will need supervision. No one runs a power tool.

## <i class="fas fa-cut"></i> Bandsaw night ##
Like in years past, we will have some bandsaws set up and available for cutting blocks. Please come in with a design in hand and drawn in pencil on the block itself. Be prepared to change your design if the bandsaw operator does not feel the design is posible, or safe.

We will offer two nights for cutting, however the first night we will have more saws and be prepared for faster service. The second night there will be fewer stations.

## <i class="fas fa-weight"></i> Official Weigh In ##
2019-02-20 - Den Meeting
Durring the Den meetings, parents/scouts can drop off cars to be weighed. Any car which does not meet the weight requirements must be modified before they can be accepted. We prefer that the cars be modified right there on the spot. Then the cars will be held till the race. Thomas will be setup with a table by the gym to accept cars. The pack has some weights and coins but if your concerned with how the car looks then bring something to glue to the car.

## <i class="fas fa-car"></i> Race Day ##

Race day starts at 9:00 AM on the 22th (Saturday) and will go till Noon or untill all the races have been completed and awards are given out.
