![QR Code to Rules](/cgi-bin/qrc.cgi?size=128&path=events/2020-2021/pinewood-derby/rules.md)
Cars must follow the rules or they will not be accepted. Cars may also not come into contact with other cars and may be removed from racing if we can not make accommodations. Please avoid adding to many decorations on the sides of the cars.

* [Official Race Car Rules](rules.md)
    * Remember 5 ounces, no more! Light cars WILL NOT WIN!
    * Note Bottom clearance!
    * Cars found to interfere with other cars can not be raced!

<br style="clear:both">

Cars should be built by the scout according to their age. As scouts age up, they should be taking more control over their car. Webelos should be doing everything, on the other end Lions will need help with everything. Bear and up should be able to use tools. Tiger and Wolf will need supervision. No scout runs a power tool.

## <i class="fas fa-cut"></i>Bandsaw Cutting ##
2024-01-17
Like in years past, we will have some bandsaws set up and available for cutting blocks. Please come in with a design in hand and drawn in pencil on the block itself. Alternatively, a side and top view of the car can be submitted on paper. Be prepared to change your design if the bandsaw operator does not feel the design is posible, or safe.

You will be tapped den-by-den to go to get your car cut.

## <i class="fas fa-weight"></i> Official Weigh In ##
2024-02-21 - Drop-off
Come in through the scout door (the one under the columns) and there will be a sign-in table there for weighing and collecting the vehicles operated by adult leaders. This is your last chance to add final weights and graphite to wheels on vehicles, as they will be packed away until Saturday's race after that!
