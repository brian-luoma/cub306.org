![Broad Creek][bc_img]
This spring we will be camping in [Broad Creek Scout Reservation][bc_home]
at [Camp Oest's][bc_oest_map] *Apache Bluff* site.

This camp site is much further away and should give our scouts a feeling of more
adventure. As we are further away we will not be able to buy food locally quite
as easily, so we will be collecting money and buying food as a Pack. If you have
special diet needs let us know.

* When :
    * **Signup by** - 2019-04-24 (Wednesday Meeting Before)
    * **Event** - 2019-04-27 to 2019-04-28 (Saturday - Sunday)
    * **How Much** - $10 per camper (payment due by April 24th)
* Where :
    * Apache Bluff Site @ [Camp Oest][bc_oest_map] in [Broad Creek Scout Reservation](http://www.broadcreekbsa.org) 
    * [Google Map][map] - [Directions][bc_direction]
    * [Parking Rules][bc_parking]

>Broad Creek Memorial Scout Reservation<br>
>1929 Susquehanna Hall Road<br>
>Whiteford, Maryland 21160-1703<br>

We also ask that every scout attending have a medical form filled out. Having
these forms on hand is a [BSA requirement][bsa_requirement]
for overnight camping and allows for any adult leader to have medical services
administered to a scout. We ask that these forms be turned in at the same time
as payment is given (April 24th).
