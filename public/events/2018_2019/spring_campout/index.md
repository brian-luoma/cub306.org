![Broad Creek][bc_img]
This spring we will be camping in [Broad Creek Scout Reservation][bc_home]
at [Camp Oest's][bc_oest_map] *Apache Bluff* site.

This camp site is much further away and should give our scouts a feeling of more
adventure. As we are further away we will not be able to buy food locally quite
as easily, so we will be collecting money and buying food as a Pack. If you have
special diet needs let us know.
