![Broad Creek][bc_img]
This spring we will be camping in [Broad Creek Scout Reservation][bc_home]
at [Camp Oest's][bc_oest_map] *Apache Bluff* site.

This camp site is much further away and should give our scouts a feeling of more
adventure. As we are further away we will not be able to buy food locally quite
as easily, so we will be collecting money and buying food as a Pack. If you have
special diet needs let us know.

* When :
    * **Signup by** - 2019-04-24 (Wednesday Meeting Before)
    * **Event** - 2019-04-27 to 2019-04-28 (Saturday - Sunday)
    * **How Much** - $10 per camper (payment due by April 24th)
* Where :
    * Apache Bluff Site @ [Camp Oest][bc_oest_map] in [Broad Creek Scout Reservation][bc_home]
    * [<i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Google Map][map] - [Directions][bc_direction]
    * [Parking Rules][bc_parking]

>Broad Creek Memorial Scout Reservation<br>
>1929 Susquehanna Hall Road<br>
>Whiteford, Maryland 21160-1703<br>

<i class="fas fa-ambulance"></i> We also ask that every scout attending have a medical form filled out. Having
these forms on hand is a [BSA requirement][bsa_requirement]
for overnight camping and allows for any adult leader to have medical services
administered to a scout. We ask that these forms be turned in at the same time
as payment is given (April 24th).

[BSA Medical Form A & B][bsa_med_a_b]

If you have any questions please email [Wil][camp] or [Thomas][mast].

## Parking ##
[![Oest Map][bc_oest_map]][bc_oest_map]
We can not park more then one car at Apache Bluff. A parking lot is available to
use just below the site (see [map][bc_oest_map]). When showing up to the camp
site, you can stop and park at the camp, unload and then move your car for the
next Camper. Overnight Wil's van will take the spot and serve as both our 
emergency vehicle and food storage.
