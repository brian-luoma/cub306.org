Our camping coordinator [Wil Heslop][camp] is putting the final
touches to the schedule and menu for the family campout. Last years "pot-luck"
style worked out pretty well so we will try it again. Expect a "google sheets"
link soon for sining up. This year we are changing the days, camping from
Saturday to Sunday to allow for more day time adventures such as more hikes,
more running, and by all means noise!

* When :
    * **Signup by** - 2018-10-06 (Saturday Befor)
    * **Event** - 2018-10-13 to 2018-10-14 (Saturday - Sunday)
* Where :
    * [Hilton Area][hilton] @ the Patapsco State Park - 
    * [Google Map][map]

## Menu ##
Like last year, the menu is an "organized potluck". The google sheets link
([what is that][sheet]) below is an online spread
sheet where each line is an item the group needs. Signup for which ever items
you feel you can bring for the group. If you have any questions or would like to
signup for items through mail, then send a message to our
camping coordinator [Wil Heslop][camp].

* [Google Sheets][menu]

## Signup ##
There are two ways to signup.

1. The primary way is to put your scouts name down
on the [menu][menu] as shown above, we can find you in our roster from that. 
2. The second way is to
send an email to [camping@cub306.org][camp]


## Packing List ##
Here is a list of items to get you started. There are other things you could
bring, but for those who are new to camping this is a great place to start:
