## EMail ##

The Pack News is run by an [Electronic mailing list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list) run by software called [Mailman](http://www.list.org). We do not currently have an expert at this system. We also offer [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol) Email address for leaders.
