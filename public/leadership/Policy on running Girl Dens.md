2. Running joint meetings with multiple sets of committed leaders will reduce burn out.

## Questions and Answers

Excerpts from [BSA's FAQ](https://i9peu1ikn3a16vg4e45rqi17-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UPDATED-Family-Scouting-FAQ-2-11-191.pdf).

**Q: How are packs and dens structured?**

Cub Scout dens are single gender â€” all boys or all girls. Cub Scout packs, meanwhile, can include any combination of all-boy or all-girl dens. The choice is left to individual leaders in consultation with their chartered organization. This hybrid model builds on the benefit of a single-gender program while also providing character and leadership opportunities for both boys and girls.


**Q: Should dens for girls and dens for boys meet at the same time and place?**

It is up to the chartered organization and the pack or the den to decide meeting times and places.

**Q: Can separate boy and girl dens work on the same activity at the same time together?**

There is no set rule or guideline on this. If appropriate, this can be treated the same as two dens of the same gender working together. It will be up to the good judgement of leaders to decide what is best for their units.
