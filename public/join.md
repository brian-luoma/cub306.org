Contrary to what people may say, there seams to be no shortage of interested youth who want to be in scouts. Kids love scouts. On the other hand, parents with extra time is **very** hard to come by. We need people for both large and small roles.

On top of that we also follow the "two deep leadership" as defined by the [BSA Youth Protection Mission Statement](https://www.scouting.org/training/youth-protection/). In short, this means we need at all times two adult leaders for all dens at all times. While currently we have all the den leaders we need, we need a assistant den leaders and backup assistant den leaders all who have taken the youth protection training.

We understand that everyone is busy and we are working hard to break up tasks in to both large and small commitments to fit everyones schedule.

| Role | Commitment | Duties | Reward |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| Cub Master | Highest | You run the show | As the current leader in a year |
| Den Leader | High | Run weekly den meetings, track advancement | High, watching kids grow is just the coolest!
| Assistant Den Leader | Medium | Attend den meetings, assist with planning | Just as much fun, less planning |
| Back up Assistant Den Leader | Low | Attend when needed | Lowest commitment and you get to were a uniform
| Event Coordinator | Low/Medium | Run one specific event, plan, schedule | Contribute without commiting on an ongoing basis
| Committee Member | Low | Attend Parent Meetings and vote on Pack issues, accational task assignments | Help drive the direction of the pack.
| Parent Meeting Attendee | Low | Same as Committee Member | Vote, express opinions, drive direction, no commitment unless you want to. |
