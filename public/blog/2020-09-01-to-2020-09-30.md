### Email Addresses
We have changed your email addresses again for all our den leaders. Every age of
scouts will be assigned a den number which will stay with scouts for their entire
with us. Each Den Leader will get a matching email address which will not change
from year to year. Additionally you can optionally [buy](https://www.scoutshop.org/cub-scout-den-numeral-1-10701.html)
and put a den patch on your scouts uniform. As dens are created (by adding girls dens)
we will create new den numbers. When a den completes scouts, it will be recycled
with a new group of scouts to be the new "Den 5". Den flags can also be built over
the years.
