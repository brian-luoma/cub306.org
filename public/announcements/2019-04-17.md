## Service Project ##

April 27th

The Catonsville Presbyterian Church has scheduled a Spring Cleanup on April 27th. The event starts at 9 AM and will focus on cleanup and some planting in the native gardens and woodlands.

The work shifts usually last an hour or two, depending on who shows up.

For more information contact the [Cub Master](mailto:cubmaster@cub306.org) or [Ron Gunderson](mailto:cinron.md@gmail.com?subject="cub+scout+service+project)

This does count as a service project!
