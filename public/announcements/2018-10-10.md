## Pack Anouncements ##
2018-10-10, Wednesday, will be a Den meeting night. All dens will meet in their normal rooms. If any one has any questions please find Thomas Cherry, the Cub Master either before or after the meeting.

### Popcorn ###
Thanks to all who have already made sales and attended our first "show and sell" event. We have raised $1720 online and $450 through direct sales. A great start, keep it up! For information on setting up an online account see:

### Camping ###
A huge number of people have signed up, so far we have 22 familys with 60 people saying they will attend, most overnight. The turn out is actually really high so if you have a choice in tents, bring a smaller one. It's going to be tight fitting everyone in. Also, plan for the closest packing lot to fill up so try to fit into one car if you can and also remember there is an overflow parking to the right of "shelter 201". We may send another email as we get closer to the date, so stay tuned.

### Parent/Leader Meeting ###
This Thursday, 2018-10-11, will be a Parent/Leader meeting from 7:00 to 9:00. We meet in the "library" one of the rooms in the front of the church. All are invited. If your interested in volitering please consider attending one of our meetings. Some of our dens have grown quite a bit (Like Tigers) this year, we always need more "hands on deck".
