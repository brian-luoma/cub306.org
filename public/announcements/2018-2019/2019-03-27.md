If you were not able to bring your food donations to the Blue & Gold, just bring them to our next meeting and we can convey them to the CEA. See [Thomas Cherry](mailto:cubmaster@cub306.org) for more information or help.

## Web site Changes ##
A new section has been added to the web site, "announcements". These are short  descriptions of upcoming events which display on a schedule. We hope this will allow us to better communicate with all of you as we can pre-load the site with events to keep you all up to date on what is going on while not overwhelming everyone with to much info.
