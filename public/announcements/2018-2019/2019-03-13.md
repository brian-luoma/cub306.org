All dens will meet, including the Lions.

## Scouting For Food ##

March is Scouting for Food month, when scouts do a food drive. At this weeks meeting we will be passing out door hangers with instructions for how people can donate food through our Pack. We ask scouts to try to collect as many food items as they can and bring them to the Blue & Gold dinner so that we can drop them off at the Catonsville Emergency Assistance (http://catonsvillehelp.org)
