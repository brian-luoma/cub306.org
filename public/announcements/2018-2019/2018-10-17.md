### Camping ###

Thanks everyone for helping put together a great camping experience. We only wish more people could have attended. Given the turn out this year and how quickly camp sites seam to be reservered, we have gone ahead and reserved two camp sites for next years fall campout.

If you have any ideas or suggestions on how we can improve our camping events for the future, please send them to camping@cub306.org.
