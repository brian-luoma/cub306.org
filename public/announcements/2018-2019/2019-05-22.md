## Last Pack Meeting ##

The 29th of this month we will have the final Pack meeting of the season, check with your Den leaders if your not sure your scout has all their requirements finished.

Also, at that meeting we are asking that all scouts attend with both their current neckerchief and next years den. We want to move everyone up in a ceremony before the summer. 

Remember: Lions &rarr; Tigers &rarr; Wolfs &rarr; Bears &rarr; Webelos
