## Rough Agenda ##

Since we don't have the "pie in the face" activity to fill time, my idea is that we try to get the formal things out of the way pretty fast

1. Announcements - 5 min
2. awards / vests - 10 min
3. Gift exchange - 10 min
5. break out for games
6. cake
4. Hand out pinewood derby cars - 5 min (maybe we just set up a table)

For games I thought of having a different game in each corner of the room, kids can go to each one as they like.

* clothes pin samurai - blind folded kid covered in clothes pins in a ring, other kids try to get the pins off without getting tagged.
* egg in spoon race
* bug draw (for the younger kids) roll a die and draw a bug part till it get's really funky looking
    * start with body
    * dice roll :  1-head, 2-feelers, 3-legs, 4-eyes, 5-wings, 6-done
* balloon game - keep off ground and in ring

2 activates that are active and older kids can do, 2 that are a bit more easy on the younger kids
