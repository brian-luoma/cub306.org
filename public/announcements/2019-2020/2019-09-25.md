## Den Meetings
2019-09-25 - Our First Pack Meeting of the Seasons - Full Uniform if you have it.

## Pack Meeting
We will have our first pack meeting this week. We will be doing our "Campfire" layout, if your new, bring a flashlight. We will have some skits, some awards, and some games. 

## Signup/Questions
There will be leaders available before, and after the meeting to answer questions, and other signup tasks. Look for an adult in a uniform if you need help or have questions.

## Camping
We are having our fall campout October 12th to 13th. As in past years the fall campout will be "pot luck". We have a "Google Spread Sheet" too signup for what you would like to contribute. We also need to know how many people you would like to bring with you as we have limits on how many people we can fit in the campsite. To this point however, we have two camp sites this year, so we can accommodate twice as many people which is very exciting.
