2019-20-02 - Den Meetings

## Camping SIGNUP!
Another reminder, we are having our fall campout October 12th to 13th. As in past years the fall campout will be "pot luck". We have a "Google Spread Sheet" too signup for what you would like to contribute. We also need to know how many people are attending. There is still plenty of room as we have two camp sites this year, but we would like to make plans knowing how many people will be attending.
