### iFly March 29

iFLY is proud to collaborate with the Boy Scouts of America and all Cub Scouts, Webelos Scouts, Scouts BSA, and Venturers across the nation. Through this collaboration, we offer Scouts a chance to earn the STEM Nova Award and experience firsthand how flying accelerates learning.

The Up and Away Nova Award is focused on Engineering and will count as one of the four Nova Awards applied to STEM subjects. Fluid Dynamics is the Study of how fluids (liquids, gases, and plasma) behave and interact with other materials.

This event is open to ALL Scouts registered with any Council of the Boy Scouts of America, regardless of rank and gender. Please be advised that iFLY does not employ registered/certified BSA Counselors; these individuals must be sourced from your local BSA Community.
