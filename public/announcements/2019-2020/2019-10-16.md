## Camping
Thanks everyone for a great camping event this past weekend. If you have any pictures you want to share with the pack and possible have included in the Blue and Gold Slide show please send them to [events@cub306.org](mailto:events@cub306.org?subject=Sprint%20Campout).

## Popcorn Fund Raising
We are in our final stretch for popcorn sales. We only have a couple more weeks to make our goal. Don't forget that you can always use a paper form instead of the App to make sales the old fashion way. If you need one please see the cub master or Tracy at the meeting.
