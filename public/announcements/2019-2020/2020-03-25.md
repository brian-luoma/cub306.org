## What to do with a scout stuck at home
Is your scout suffering from Coronavirus cabin fever? School home work packets driving you all mad? Here are some scouting activities you all can try at home:

### Emergency Preparedness Award

The Bear den is working remotely on the Emergency Preparedness Award which is a really nice idea. Given the current news and abundance of time on our hands everyone from Tiger to Arrow of Light can work on this. Reach out to Eric Silva for tips on how to do these requirements at home.

* [Eric Silva](mailto:bear1@cub306.org)

NOTE, requirement 4 for Tiger, let me see what we can do to help with that. (We could a video chat or something if there is interest.)

### The New Yo-Yo Adventure
This preview adventure (meaning its a new award being tested out) gives Wolf, Bear, and Webelos Scouts the opportunity to learn the concepts that make a yo-yo work and the basic physics of a pendulum. The adventure has only 7 requirements. As a parent you can record the achievements in Scout Book Link on resource page). If you don't feel comfortable using Scout Book you can send photos of your scout demonstrating the requirements to [Sparky Zivin](mailto:awards@cub306.org?subject=yo-yo) who can record it for you.

I would also like to mention that the resource page has both videos and lesson plans? It's a pre-canned event wrapped in a box just perfect for being locked in a house for weeks with nothing to do!

### Youth Protection Pamphlet
There is a pamphlet on the inside cover of all the Cubscout handbooks. This needs to be done at home before the yearly awards can be given out. If you lost yours here is a link below. Report completion to your Den leader.

### Anything from a Cub Scout Handbook

Scout still need a task, pull out the Cub Scout hand book and pick something they can do at home. Remember, Bears and above can use tool. Any task you do at home can be signed off by your Den leader or [Sparky Zivin](mailto:awards@cub306.org?subject=at%20home%20work). Or just start checking things off in the scout book and show us in person when we all meet again.
