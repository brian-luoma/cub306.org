# Pack 306 News - 2020-05-20

## Current Plans
* Spring Camping has been canceled. 
* Most dens will continue to meet till the end of school. Many have finished their requirements but a handful need a little more time to finish off some last remaining requirements. Please work with your den leaders.
* Graduations will be handled at the den levels and be online this year. We are starting to acquire awards now and each den will schedule a date based on when they finish their last requirements and when we get awards delivered from the scout store.
* Arrow of Light would like to bridge in person. To handle this we are working with the Troop too provided a ceremony where no more than 10 people present at a time. More details to come as we secure a location and a date.
* We will have a summer program this year, we just don't know exactly what it will look like yet. We hope that we can schedule a mix of online events and something outside. Our main goal is too provided some opportunities for interactions for our Scouts who may not have as many summer activities to attend. Our preference will be to come up with an outside event (like a scavenger hunt, or a photo tour hike) where we do an activity in the real world (with limited numbers) and report back on line. As in the past two summers, we will schedule one event a month. 

## Friends of Scouting
Friends of Scouting is a fundraising campaign for our local District. Much of scouting is run at the local level, either in your Pack or at the District. Donations help us maintain recruitment campaigns, camping facilities, and adult training. The local district is also our interface to the larger scouting world. In years past we have always invited someone from the district to attend one of our events like Blue and Gold, however this year we could not as we all know why. Please consider making your donations on line using the URL below.

## Scouting for food
We are working with the church (CPC) to provided local food assistance for people in need in Catonsville. This year the CPC is making available two drop off cans for food. You can find these at the CPC (the church we meet at) by the "garage". The cans are two large gray trashcans on the left side of the garage. Someone from the Pack will try to take a picture of them and email this group. If you can't find the cans, let one of us know and we can make other arrangements.

## Whittling Chip
For those Bears, Webelos, and Arrow Of Lights who need to earn Whittling chip, The cub master is offering web training. How this will work is that Thomas will video chat with the parent and scout and walk them through doing the knife safety training at home. Obviously someone will need to practice things like passing a knife so a parent is required to help facilitate that on the other side. To sign up, use the form below or email the cub master.
