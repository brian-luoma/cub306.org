## Virtual Camping Success
Thank you everyone who participated in the Virtual Camping event this past weekend. Please send us photos to [events@cub306.org](mailto:events@cub306.org?subject=virtual%20camping). Also, if you were not on the webex chat but you did go camping, send the [cub master](mailto:cubmaster@cub306.org?subject=virtual%20camping) an email so that we can get a patch for your scout!

## Whittling Chip

For those Bears, Webelos, and Arrow Of Lights who need to earn Whittling chip, The cub master is offering web training. How this will work is that Thomas will video chat with the parent and scout and walk them through doing the knife safety training at home. Obviously someone will need to practice things like passing a knife so a parent is required to help facilitate that on the other side. To sign up, use the form below or email the cub master.
