## Den Meetings
2019-09-18 - all Dens will meet including Lions.

## Signup/Questions
The Cub Master will be available before, during, and after the meeting to answer questions, accept dues and help setup emails for leaders.

## Camping
We are having our fall campout October 12th to 13th. As in past years the fall campout will be "pot luck". We have a "Google Spread Sheet" too signup for what you would like to contribute. We also need to know how many people you would like to bring with you as we have limits on how many people we can fit in the campsite. To this point however, we have two camp sites this year, so we can accommodate twice as many people which is very exciting.
