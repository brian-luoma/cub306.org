# Pack 306 News - 2020-05-06

* We are still on hold watching to see if we can put together a spring campout. Like everyone we are waiting to see what the Governor will do in the next couple of weeks.
* We are waiting for a few more Dens to finish their programs before we do final awards.
* Sunflower seeds are going out to families to participate in our event to promote [pollinators](https://cub306.org/events/2019-2020/Sunflower_Project.pdf).

Dens with meetings this week:

* Tiger, Bears, Webelos. AoL den is also investigating web meetings.

## Scouting for food
This Tuesday is [Giving Tuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/organizations), a day to give back to community. Normally the Pack does a food drive to collect food for the Catonsville Emergency Assistance, but we don't think we will be able to pull this together under the current circumstances. In lieu of that we suggest people make a [donation](http://catonsvillehelp.org/donating-money/) instead.

## Whittling Chip

For those Bears, Webelos, and Arrow Of Lights who need to earn Whittling chip, The cub master is offering web training. How this will work is that Thomas will video chat with the parent and scout and walk them through doing the knife safety training at home. Obviously someone will need to practice things like passing a knife so a parent is required to help facilitate that on the other side. To sign up, use the form below or email the cub master.
