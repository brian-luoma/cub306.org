### 2020-02-19 - Pinewood Derby Weigh-in Den Meeting

Weigh in will be on the 19th. Please be sure to consult the [Rules Page] (http://cub306.org/events/2019-2020/pinewood-derby/rules.md). Most common problem cars have is with the weight. Cars can not be **OVER** 5 ounces. Weigh in will be in the scout rooms during the normal meeting day, the 19th. Please drop off before or after your den meeting. Once checked in you will not be able to take your car home. You can not turn in a car on a latter date without pre-arranging it. Registration will go faster if you pre-register with the above link.

### 2020-02-22 - Pinewood Derby Race Day!

Saturday the 22nd, Race event is from 9:00 to 1:00. Race will start around at 9:30 to give people time to view the cars and consider their category votes. We will also have a couple of test runs of the track and software. This year we will be using some upgraded track timing equipment which should make the race event go a little faster and be more accurate.

Good luck!
