# Pack 306 News - July

# Stargazing

We have an activity planned on August 12th - a virtual stargazing party. First, as we get closer to the event, you'll receive a link to a video talking about the constellations that we could expect to see that night, and talking a little about why constellations are important. Then (weather permitting), we suggest you go to a wide green space and lie out under the stars to see how many constellations your scout(s) can spot. The goal will be to have the scouts spot 5 constellations and draw what they see either while they're there (bring a flashlight), or when they're done. We're picking that night because it's a Wednesday and most people can squeeze a Wednesday into their plans, but ALSO because it's the peak of the [Perseid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids) meteor shower, which can have up to 100 shooting stars per hour. We highly recommend tuning in and finding a space to watch the stars, maybe on one of the many open ball fields we have in our neighborhoods (as long as it's not trespassing). 
 
The video will be available for you to have as a rain date if weather is disagreeable or if you're busy that night.

After your scout has stargazed, please send a message to [Eric Silva](mailto:wolf1@cub306.org?subject=stargazing) along with a picture of your 5 constellations so we can record your attendance. Have a great rest of your summer, and we'll talk to you in the fall.

# Food Drive

Due to the pandemic, a proper food drive was never conducted. Emails have been sent out to Scouting units asking for help. If you can, please consider making a food donation to the CEA:
