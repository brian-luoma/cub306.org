## Next Year Recruitment

We are looking to fill some positions for next year. Many individuals have already been reached out to who have expressed interest and a couple of positions already filled. Don't be surprised if you get an email from me soon. Currently we would like to know who has a kid who would like to join as a **Lion** or **Tiger**, that is, who is going to be a **Kindergarten** or **First Grader** next year. Both of the age groups will need Den Leaders as these Dens are where most of our scouts join.

If you have been with the Pack, and you have a younger son or daughter, being a Den leader is a great way of sharing scouting with them, and a great way to watch an entire set of kids grow up. Joining as a leader also adds your voice to desisions affecting the direction and events we engage in.

We are also looking for people to help as:

* Assistant Den leaders across the board
* Event Coordinators
* Fund Raising Committee members
* Committee Members at large

## Other announcements

### Scouting for food
We are working with the church (CPC) to provided local food assistance for people in need in Catonsville. This year the CPC is making available two drop off cans for food. You can find these at the CPC (the church we meet at) by the "garage". The cans are two large gray trashcans on the left side of the garage. Someone from the Pack will try to take a picture of them and email this group. If you can't find the cans, let one of us know and we can make other arrangements.

### Friends of Scouting
Friends of Scouting is a fundraising campaign for our local District. Much of scouting is run at the local level, either in your Pack or at the District. Donations help us maintain recruitment campaigns, camping facilities, and adult training. The local district is also our interface to the larger scouting world. In years past we have always invited someone from the district to attend one of our events like Blue and Gold, however this year we could not as we all know why. Please consider making your donations on line using the URL below.

### Whittling Chip
For those Bears, Webelos, and Arrow Of Lights who need to earn Whittling chip, The cub master is offering web training. How this will work is that Thomas will video chat with the parent and scout and walk them through doing the knife safety training at home. Obviously someone will need to practice things like passing a knife so a parent is required to help facilitate that on the other side. To sign up, use the form below or email the cub master.
