# 2020-04-01 - Shut Down Updates
No in-person meetings this week.

* Lions - no meetings
* Tiger - no meetings
* Wolf - no meetings
* Bear - no meetings
* Webelos 1 - video meeting (with [zoom](https://zoom.us))
* Webelos 2 - no meetings

## Updates
There will be no organized in-person meetings through April. We have made this decision based on several factors:

* Safety
* School is closed
* The Church facilities are closed.

### Video Meetings?
In the mean time we are trying to figure out if we can do Den Video Meetings if for no reason then to give the Scouts an outlet and a reach out. The Webelos had a video meeting on the 25th and it was very successful. If your Den organizes a meeting we ask that some basic rules be followed:

* Parent Supervision
* Only one person should be un-mute at a time

Some Den leaders may offer to work with individual scouts to complete requirements. We will require that the parents help set up connections on their side and be present during the chat.

### All Future Events
All future events are currently being rescheduled. Obviously we need to wait to see what we are allowed to do and what will be opened up when we are done with Social Distancing. Currently we are looking to move the camping to the later half of May. Scouting For Food and Blue & Gold is up in the air, we will let people know as soon as we can. Also scouts have till the end of July to finish their rank requirements.

## Home Activities For Scouts
Some example activities to keep your scouts busy.

### Youth Protection Pamphlet
There is a pamphlet on the inside cover of all the Cubscout handbooks. This needs to be done at home before the yearly awards can be given out. If you lost yours here is a link below. Report completion to your Den leader.

### Emergency Preparedness Award

The Bear den is working remotely on the Emergency Preparedness Award which is a really nice idea. Given the current news and abundance of time on our hands everyone from Tiger to Arrow of Light can work on this. Reach out to Eric Silva for tips on how to do these requirements at home.

NOTE, requirement 4 for Tiger, let me see what we can do to help with that. (We could a video chat or something if there is interest.)

### The New Yo-Yo Adventure
This preview adventure (meaning its a new award being tested out) gives Wolf, Bear, and Webelos Scouts the opportunity to learn the concepts that make a yo-yo work and the basic physics of a pendulum. The adventure has only 7 requirements. As a parent you can record the achievements in Scout Book Link on resource page). If you don't feel comfortable using Scout Book you can send photos of your scout demonstrating the requirements to [Sparky Zivin](mailto:awards@cub306.org?subject=yo-yo) who can record it for you.

I would also like to mention that the resource page has both videos and lesson plans? It's a pre-canned event wrapped in a box just perfect for being locked in a house for weeks with nothing to do!

### Anything from a Cub Scout Handbook

Scout still need a task, pull out the Cub Scout hand book and pick something they can do at home. Remember, Bears and above can use tool. Any task you do at home can be signed off by your Den leader or [Sparky Zivin](mailto:awards@cub306.org?subject=at%20home%20work). Or just start checking things off in the scout book and show us in person when we all meet again.
