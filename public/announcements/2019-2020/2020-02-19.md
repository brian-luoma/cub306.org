# 2020-02-19 - Den Meeting

Weigh in will be on the 19th from 6:45 to 8:15 and we will be set up in the Scout Rooms (by the gym).

Please drop off cars before or after your den meeting. We will have someone in the "scout room" during the entire meeting and we can stay as long as there are people dropping off cars

Be sure to consult the [Rules Page] (http://cub306.org/events/2019-2020/pinewood-derby/rules.md). The most common problem a car has is with the weight. Cars can not be **OVER** 5 ounces.

Once checked in you will not be able to take your car home. You can not turn in a car on a later date without pre-arranging it and none can be expected on race day.

**NOTE**: Registration and check-in will go faster if you pre-register with the link below.

Pinewood Derby dates to keep in mind

### 2020-02-22 - Pinewood Derby Race Day!

Saturday the 22nd, Race event is from 9:00 to 1:00. Race will start around at 9:30 to give people time to view the cars and consider their category votes. We will also have a couple of test runs of the track and software. This year we will be using upgraded track timing equipment which should make the race event go a little faster and be more accurate.

**NOTE**: We will not know the exact race length till we know how many cars we have.

At the event, if you take pictures and you want to share, send them to [events@cub306.org](mailto:events@cub306.org).

Good luck!
