## Den Meetings
2019-10-23 - Den Meetings - Lions will not meet this week.

## Popcorn Fund Raising
So our popcorn fund raising is nearing its end very quickly. This Monday is the last day we can take sales on the paper form. If you need a paper form, hunt a leader down on Wednesday. We are really close to our goal, help us cross that. Be sure to show your scouts the prize sheet.

## Pack Meeting Next week
Next week (the 30th) is a Pack Meeting. We will be having a Bob Cat ceremony for the new scouts so make plans and bring your camera. If your scout is still working on the requirements then this weeks meeting you don't want to miss.

## Signup/Questions
There will be leaders available before, and after the meeting to answer questions, and other signup tasks. Look for an adult in a uniform if you need help or have questions.
