### An Eagle Scout Project

Jack Callahan of Troop 306 is working on his Eagle project and asked if I would include a message from him:

>Hi, my name is Jack Callahan and I am a member of the BSA Troop 306. I have been working on my Eagle Scout Project for the past few months, and now I am taking action. My goal is to help the community learn the importance of the American flag, and how to properly dispose of them.
>
>I am collecting as many tattered and worn American flags throughout the month of June in order to help teach the community about the importance of properly disposing an American Flag when it is no longer fit to serve as a symbol of the nation. Due to Covid, I will then be live streaming a flag retirement ceremony, which I encourage everyone to experience once in their lives.
>
>I will be personally collecting any flag donations at the Catonsville Frederick Road farmer’s market from 9am-noon on June 14th, 21st, and 28th.  Please come by and see me there if you have a flag to retire or just to say “hi”.   I am also having a fundraiser at Peace a Pizza on June 17th from 4-7pm. If you could mention my project while placing a pick-up order at Peace a Pizza during my fundraiser, that would be greatly appreciated and helpful towards achieving my project goals.
>
>The flag retirement ceremony will be on July 5th, and I will provide the information to view the streaming ceremony later this month. Thank you for any flags you can donate, supporting me during my fundraiser, and being a part of my Eagle Project.
>
>Please check my project’s Facebook page (and like/share) for frequent updates, including many fun facts about the American flag:

### Friends of Scouting
Friends of Scouting is a fundraising campaign for our local District. Much of scouting is run at the local level, either in your Pack or at the District. Donations help us maintain recruitment campaigns, camping facilities, and adult training. The local district is also our interface to the larger scouting world. In years past we have always invited someone from the district to attend one of our events like Blue and Gold, however this year we could not as we all know why. Please consider making your donations on line using the URL below.

### Scouting for food
We are working with the church (CPC) to provided local food assistance for people in need in Catonsville. This year the CPC is making available two drop off cans for food. You can find these at the CPC (the church we meet at) by the "garage". The cans are two large gray trashcans on the left side of the garage. Someone from the Pack will try to take a picture of them and email this group. If you can't find the cans, let one of us know and we can make other arrangements.
