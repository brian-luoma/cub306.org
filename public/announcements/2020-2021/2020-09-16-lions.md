## Welcome

2020-2021 Scouting year is just getting started, if your getting this email it means your have expressed interest in the Lion Program. My name is Thomas Cherry, I'm the cub master. I'm here to answer any questions you might have and to setup a basic framework for how the Lion Program works.

## Meetings

Lions meet at least once a month and they attend all Pack events. For the rest of the calendar year Pack 306 is meeting virtual and this will extend to Lions as well. We will re-address this if Baltimore County Public Schools go to in-person schooling, or Lion parents are unanimous in a decision to meet in person.

### Meeting Format
Lion meetings are built around actives in the Lion handbook. Parents take turns going through the lessons. I'm here to help you all get started, so I'm going to suggest that everyone get a handbook and go through it. If you find activities that you feel comfortable leading, let me know and we can form a schedule. Otherwise, I'll pick parents randomly.

### First meeting
I would like to suggest that we get started with meetings next week (22nd)? How does that sound to everyone here? Our goal in the past has been to get everyone to meet and know each other, and then settle on a fixed schedule by October. Until then I'll host a google meeting every Wednesday to get you all started.

(side note, I am doing double duty with the oldest group, so I may be going back and forth between meetings).

## Stuff
You will need the "Cub Scout Lion Kit" (it's a book). This is a must. Optionally you should get the shirt but really, you don't _need_ this till we start meeting in person, but we feel it may help your scout get more in the mood since it is a video meeting.
