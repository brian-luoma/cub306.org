## Congratulations on Bridging and Arrow of Light
This Saturday, March 20th, the Arrow of Lights (5th grade) graduated up to the Boy Scouts. Normally we do this at the Blue and Gold Dinner, but with covid restrictions we could not have everyone together. Below is a link you can watch and if you know one of the scouts then please congratulate them. We wish all the best to those who bridged and were awarded the Arrow of Light:
Conner, Darasimi, Dorian, Leo, Oliver, Owen, Sage, Vince, and William.

## Events

### Meet a Community Leader
The AoL Den has invited someone from Johnny Olszewski's office to speak to us about being a Community Leader. If anyone has a similar requirement then please join us at 7:00 on March 31st. The vast majority of people we asked to speak with us have said 'no' due to being too busy with with covid, so we would really like to make our guest feel welcome with a good showing of scouts.

[Google Meet][meet] - 7:00 March 31st.

### Scouting for Food
By now most everyone has gotten some of those door hangers for Scouting for Food, and emails have not been clear on what exactly to do with them. The Pack would like to collect all the food gathered by the Scouts on March 27th by either you dropping it off at the [Cub Master's house][tom-email] or with one of the leaders picking it up from you. On the card, fill out a date that your scout will be pickup the food from the house where it was left. Then you either keep the food till we can collect it from you, or bring it to us. All collected foods will be taken to [Catonsville Emergancy Assistance][cea].

### Spring Camping
Planning for the Spring Camping is getting started. A year ago we reserved the Tire Park for May 1st and 2nd, however we have to choose the style of camping we want to do given that Covid is still a thing. Please checkout our survey and vote camping event you would like to participate in. We would like to start looking at the results next week so please fill it out by the end of the week (28th).
