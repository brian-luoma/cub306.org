## Socially Distant Hike
Hike Catonsville and participate in our first pack event of the year. This is a socially distant event, you may join up with any other scouts you feel safe hiking with or do the circuit with just your family. Jump on the loop at any point and get off at any point. We have things to do around the hike, so check out our event page: [September Hike](https://cub306.org/events/2020-2021/septemberhike/)
