### Scout Recruiting
Not all our schools were able to include recruiting flyers this year due to how hard they have been working to get their program up and running. If your scouts have friends interested in joining, then you can share this QR code with them:<br>

### Family Fun Fest
This weekend - This very special online-only free event will be jam-packed with a sampling of the fun things Cub Scouts across the country do day in and day out. We’ll be going big with all things Pinewood Derby, because hey, it’s kind of our thing!  But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. From astronauts to crafts and even a few special surprises it’ll be the most fun your family will have online all summer. 

Scouting is always more fun with friends, so be sure to spread the word about Family Fun Fest on September 12th!
