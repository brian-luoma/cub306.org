### Service Project for CPC

The Service Project is an annual event and our first scheduled in person pack event. Every year we meet along with the Scouts of Troop 306 to clean up the grounds for Catonsville Presbyterian Church. As this is an outdoor event in the day time we will not be cancel it so long as the Church is inviting us to participate. There will be plenty of social distancing and hand sanitizer. We will not have as many opportunities for a service project this year for the scouts who need this requirement so keep that in mind. Having said that, no one is required to attend and if you have concerns let us know and we will figure something out. This year is all about coming up with creative ways to scout.
