## Race Day
* Saturday February 27th. 9:30
* URL to be given out closer to race day
* The event will be live on You Tube.
  * **Lesson Learned**: Do not use a school device, BPCS blocks youtube!

## Car Registration
We need parents to signup before hand so that we can enter in the Scouts name, car, and car photo in the software to make the live event more engaging.

* [Car Registration Form][car-reg] - Please fill out now!

## Car Drop-off
NOTE: Cars **must not be over** 5.0 ounces, but can be under.

### Early
You can arrange to drop off your scouts car with the [Cub Master][tom-email] or [Assistant Cub Master][eric-email] at any time, and we encourage you to do so. Email or call me: 443-956-9666. We can weigh them and accept them. Bring coins or weights and glue if you want to make changes. We will not be able to provide them.

### Last Drop-off Day
We will also have a drop off night at the Church on Wednesday, February 24th between 7:00-8:00. We really can not take cars after this as we need to enter them into software. To socially distance people, signup for a time slot with the following form:
