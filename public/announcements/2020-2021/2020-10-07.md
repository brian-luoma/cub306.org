## Virtual Camping - 10th of October
Saturday, October 10, 2020 - Virtual/Backyard Camping

This Saturday we are holding our Fall Campout virtually. Virtual campout is where you setup a tent in your back yard, cook on a fire (or bbq pit) if possible and participate is some joint activities. Last years event went pretty well and we are going to repeat. While we know that it in no way compares to normal camping, it's still important for our scouts to get experience setting up tents, sleeping in difficult conditions, and eating from the fire. To complete the experience we have put together an agenda of web events to try to bring us closer together while we marshal through these times.

### Campfire
Our last event will be a campfire. We encourage everyone to build their own fire in your fire pit or grill. We will be moving the video to and from as we share with each other. For my part (the cub master) I will be introducing a new tradition in the pack.

This new tradition will include each scout contributing a stick to a pack bond fire. At the end of the bonfire, the Cub Master will collect some of the ashes and store them in a can. With each new bond fire we have, we will start by pouring our ashes into the fire. Then each scout will have a chance to add to the fire his or her own stick. When the fire is done, we will again save some of the ashes and in this way we hope is to preserve something from each fire we hold. Perhaps years from now scouts not yet born will ponder who the first scouts were who contributed the first ashes to the can.

To start this tradition I have retrieved two boxes of Pinewood derby off cuts from our storage the CPC. These are wood off cuts from at least two years of pinewood derbies. This I will use to seed the ash can. If anyone wishes to supply a stick, you can drop it off to the cub master's front porch:

Ashes from this Saturday's fire will be used in our spring campout when hopefully we can all smell and taste the same smoke and sit on the same dirt. Join us.
