We would like to invite you all back for the 2020-2021 Cub Scouting Season officially kicking off on September 12. We are excited and looking forward to this year’s Scouting program, but will need to make some important changes to ensure the program is safe, educational, and engaging. This year will be unlike any other, and the scouts will learn an important life lesson - adaptability.

This email will address Dues, the Registration process, changes to emails, and the start of our meetings. 

Due to Covid-19 we will not be having any in-person gatherings for at least the first half of the year (January).  The Scouts leaders have been focusing on developing virtual programs that continue to build on our adventures and create new opportunities. We have all had a lot of practice using web meeting software and are working on for engaging interactions with the scouts through Google Meets. While the weather is still nice, Pack 306 will be putting together some unique and some more traditional outdoor events for our scouting families’ participation, at home and nearby, while at the same time helping the Scouts to build lifelong bonds through virtual connections. Information on the upcoming events will be emailed shortly, and Den leaders will be reaching out about their individual programs. 

## Dues
* Returning Scout - $85.00
* New Scouts - $110.00
* Boys Life (Optional) $12.00

In June 2020, the BSA issued new membership rates that greatly increased national registration for all scouts, which are passed on to the local Packs. Pack 306 has made the decision to forgo some of the optional expenses (i.e., yearly t-shirts) to ensure that scouting is still accessible to everyone. This has allowed us to keep last year’s dues for all returning scouts, and only modest increases for New Scouts (which requires a one-time $25 registration fee as well). 

We anticipate a lean fundraising season and invite any and all ideas on how to help make opportunities for the Scouting program, while keeping our scouts safe. 

You can read more about the membership fee increase at: [BSA Membership Fee Increase Details and FAQ](https://scoutingwire.org/bsa-membership-fee-increase-details-and-faq/) page.

## Registration: Open

## Communication
In order to facilitate easier and consistent communications, we will be issuing each den a new email address that will travel with it until bridging from Cub Scouts to the Troop. The email addresses will reflect Den Numbers specific to each year, e.g., `Den5@cub306.org`.  (As an added bonus for the patch loving scout, corresponding den numbers can be purchased from the scout store and put on uniforms.)

We are working on transitioning the old emails to the new system and you should receive emails from your leaders within the next week or so.  As always, the email addresses can also be found on our website: [cub306.org/contact.md](https://cub306.org/contact.md). 

## Meetings
We have a full year of events planned beginning on September 12th. You can see our calendar on google here: [schedlue.pdf](https://cub306.org/schedule/schedule.pdf). (Our calendar is also on google [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=cWVmN3U2MTEwc21jMmlpZGs3dXU3N2g3a3NAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).) It is anticipated that meetings, including Pack meetings, will be virtual up until January.  However, we are optimistic that the world will improve over the winter and by spring we can open back up. However, prudence dictates that decisions regarding spring activities will be made later in the year and communicated as early as possible. 

We appreciate your patience and support as we all navigate a challenging fall.  While far from a perfect situation for a scouting program, with your help Pack 306 is going to make this a banner year.  Please feel free to share this email with potential new scouts and friends who may be interested in helping.  In a year like no other, we can help the kids learn the resilience of scouting. 

Hope to hear from you<br>
Pack 306.
