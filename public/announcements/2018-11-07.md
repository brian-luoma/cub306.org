We have a new design and new color for our Pack 306 t-shirts this year. Each Scout will receive one green, short-sleved tee as part of their registration fees. Additional shits may be ordered for scouts or families; the short sleeve version is $9 and the 3/4 sleeved Raglan style is $14. Please let your Den Leader know your preferred size and any additional shirt orders.
