We will be passing out door hangers to scouts on the 2019-03-13. These can be used
by scouts help collect food donations. We only got about 10 per scout, but if you
need more we can get them. Hang up the door hangers and then collect the food.
Bring this food to the Blue & Gold dinner and we will convey them to the Catonsville
Emergency Assistance.
