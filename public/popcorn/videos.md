Trails End has several training videos that address some common topics:

This video shows you how to set up your account, set up your webpage using the app, share your webpage, and how to conduct online direct sales from the start of the video to minute 4.13. The remainder of the video discussed wagon sales and storefront sales - which we are not doing this year. So it can be skipped. Or you can jump forward to minute 6.26 to get some general sales tips and see how to find additional helpful resources like other training videos, and promotional items you can print out and use to boost your sales.
