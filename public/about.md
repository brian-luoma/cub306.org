<!-- Title: About Pack 306 -->

# History #

We are the cub pack associated with the [Boy Scout Troop 306](http://ourtroop306.org/).  Troop 306 was founded in 1911 and has been in continuous operations since.

Cub Scout Pack 306 as originally Pack 65. Pack 65 had moved over to the Catonsville Presbyterian Church around 2014 when it needed to find a new sponser. In 2017 pack <add number> joined us.
